            synopsis:`The first chapter of the One Piece manga hit store shelves on Aug. 24, 1997 in the weekly Shōnen Jump magazine. It took less than two years for One Piece to become a full-fledged anime series with the first episode airing on Oct. 20, 1999. Since then, One Piece has grown to be the most popular manga series of all time in Japan with over 280 million volumes sold as of 2012. One Piece follows the story of a pirate named Monkey D. Luffy and his rag-tag Straw Hat pirate crew as they set-out to help Luffy become The King of the Pirates by finding a legendary treasure called One Piece that the last Pirate King Gold Roger hid at the end of the Grand Line, a series of islands separated from the rest of the world by windless oceans that cannot be sailed. While sometimes bloody, One Piece is generally good for the whole family and has such a compelling story that you’ll likely want to start reading the manga once you’ve seen any of the anime series or movies.`
